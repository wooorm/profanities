in certain contexts.

## Data

Part of the list is scraped from [Luis von Ahn’s Research Group (Carnegie
Mellon)][luis-von-ahn].  I could not find
any license information on that page.

Another list is based on the [`List of ethnic slurs` from
WikiPedia][racial-slurs].

## Contributing

Thanks, contributions are greatly appreciated!  :+1:

New words should be added to [racial.txt][racial-list] if they are racial
slurs; all other profanities should be added to [rest.txt][rest-list].

After adding a word, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies,
then `npm test` to update [support.md][support]
and open a Pull Request.
